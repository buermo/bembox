learned connect() links store and react component
better understanding of state and props - state handles the computation that happens front end
css still a pain. installed font awesome but i'm thinking import FontAwesome as a whole on every page is probably too inefficient
*content is not defined* error: css file is empty

what's this connect library? passing in all the state in one object?
at which step should data manipulation happen? database raw data is not supposed to be used directly, as there's always real time calculation
does combined reducer low efficiency? traversing all the reducers (case uniqueness?)
components are enclosed into one div in render()
still something weird about front end route

To reinit a repository, just delete .git folder and it's all free.
git commit -m takes DOUBLE quotes, not single quotes
express routing doesn't read controller/action names, it just recognizes with the url passed in to route() function and the HTTP methods
exec must be called to execute the query

find() parameter is really annoying to compose
  Quest.find({
    $and: [
      { $or: [{startDate: {$exists: false}}, {startDate: {$lt: new Date()}}] },
      { $or: [{endDate: {$exists: false}}, {endDate: {$gt: new Date()}}] }
    ]}).exec((err, quests)
